# Topify
**Topify** is a school project for the module **Interaction Design** of my study at **MCT Howest (Kortrijk)**. This project shows you your top  10 genres and songs that you can play a preview

### Test out this project
This project uses the **Spotify API**. To test the project for yourself, you can create an API id and secret via https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard. If you created a app, you can place your app id and secret in the **config.js** file in the js folder.
